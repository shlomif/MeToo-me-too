Introduction
------------

The premise of this essay / braindump / humour piece is that there is a very
strong correlation between competence and ability (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_each_according_to_his_ability,_to_each_according_to_his_needs[Karl Marx's misled quote] to sexiness / attractiveness / "hot"ness. This may in turn
correspond to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_(biology)[human biological fitness], which does not fully correspond to the so-called https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness[Physical fitness] .

We are planning to collect as many sexualised and even "sexist" jokes about both females and males from https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/[our arsenal] to evoke a strong https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me_Too_movement["Me Too"] reaction which we will then take to our advantage. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bring_It_On_(film)[Bring It On!]

We will show that these people (or non people) are noble, capable, admired,
and revered, *because* they are so sexually attractive, not despite it.

___
By the time Chuck Norris found out who John Galt is, Summer Glau already had sex with him.

*Midrash*: part of the reason why I found it funny is because the ancient Hebrew
verb https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%93%D7%A2[Yada`] had both meanings, as well as a meaning of "to create/conceive something with pleasure" and possibly other meanings of the geek jargon verb http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/H/hack.html["hack"].
